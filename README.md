This package is being built to gather data about packages that have been used in an organisations repositories, but are not maintained by the organisation, but rather its employees past and present.

Currently this is still in development, but we hope to make it a package that can be easily used by other organisations; at the moment some values are hardcoded in for clocklimited.

However if you would like to use it now you can generate a personal access token, ensure that you are a member of the teams / organisation that you wish to check. Then when generating your key, ensure that it has permissions to repo and read:org.

Rename examplepasswords.json to passwords.json, and edit it to include your token.
